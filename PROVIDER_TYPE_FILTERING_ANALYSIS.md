# Provider Type Filtering Analysis & Fix Plan

## üîç **Current Problem Analysis**

**Issue**: When in APP Data View, the Specialty Mapping screen is showing SullivanCotter Physician data mixed with APP data. This indicates that provider type filtering is not working correctly throughout the application.

**Root Cause Identified**: 
1. **IndexedDBService.getUnmappedSpecialties()** correctly filters surveys by provider type (lines 920-923)
2. **BUT** the filtering logic in `getAllSpecialtyMappings()` is flawed - it uses heuristic detection instead of relying on the actual `survey.providerType` field
3. **The issue is in lines 575-621** of IndexedDBService.ts where it tries to infer provider type from specialty names instead of using the stored `survey.providerType`

**Critical Finding**: The `getAllSpecialtyMappings()` method has complex heuristic logic that tries to guess provider type from specialty names, but this is unreliable and causes cross-contamination.

## üìä **Data Flow Analysis**

### 1. **Upload Process**
- User uploads survey data with provider type (PHYSICIAN or APP)
- Data is stored in IndexedDB with `providerType` field
- Provider type is set during upload process

### 2. **Navigation & Context**
- User selects provider type in sidebar (DATA VIEW dropdown)
- This should filter ALL subsequent screens to show only that provider type's data
- Context should be maintained across navigation

### 3. **Data Retrieval**
- Each screen should only retrieve data for the selected provider type
- Services should filter by provider type before returning data
- No cross-contamination between provider types

### 4. **Current Screens That Need Provider Type Filtering**
- ‚úÖ Upload Screen (already works - shows provider type selector)
- ‚ùå Specialty Mapping (showing mixed data)
- ‚ùå Provider Type Mapping
- ‚ùå Region Mapping  
- ‚ùå Variable Mapping
- ‚ùå Column Mapping
- ‚ùå Normalized Data
- ‚ùå Survey Analytics
- ‚ùå Regional Analytics
- ‚ùå Custom Reports
- ‚ùå Fair Market Value

## üéØ **Comprehensive Fix Plan**

### **Phase 1: Fix IndexedDBService.getAllSpecialtyMappings() - CRITICAL**
1. **Remove Heuristic Logic** (lines 575-621)
   - Remove the complex specialty name-based provider type detection
   - Use actual `survey.providerType` field instead
   - Simplify the filtering logic to be reliable

2. **Fix Provider Type Filtering**
   - When `providerType` is specified, only return mappings from surveys with that provider type
   - Ensure no cross-contamination between provider types
   - Test with both physician and APP data

### **Phase 2: Verify Data Integrity**
1. **Check Survey Data Storage**
   - Verify that surveys are stored with correct `providerType` field
   - Ensure upload process sets provider type correctly
   - Test with sample data

2. **Validate Filtering Logic**
   - Test `getUnmappedSpecialties()` with provider type filtering
   - Test `getAllSpecialtyMappings()` with provider type filtering
   - Verify no cross-contamination

### **Phase 3: Screen-by-Screen Updates**
1. **Specialty Mapping Screen**
   - Update to only show specialties for selected provider type
   - Filter survey data by provider type before processing
   - Update specialty lists to be provider-type specific

2. **Analytics Screens**
   - Update all analytics components to filter by provider type
   - Ensure charts and tables show only relevant data
   - Update filtering logic in analytics hooks

3. **Mapping Screens**
   - Update all mapping screens to be provider-type specific
   - Ensure mappings are created/updated with correct provider type
   - Filter existing mappings by provider type

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation**
1. **Upload Test Data**
   - Upload physician data
   - Upload APP data
   - Verify data is stored with correct provider types

2. **Navigation Testing**
   - Switch between provider types
   - Verify each screen shows only relevant data
   - Test all mapping and analytics screens

3. **Data Integrity Testing**
   - Verify no cross-contamination between provider types
   - Test edge cases (no data, mixed data scenarios)
   - Validate context persistence across navigation

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Key Files to Update**
1. `src/contexts/ProviderContext.tsx` - Context management
2. `src/services/IndexedDBService.ts` - Data filtering
3. `src/services/SpecialtyMappingService.ts` - Specialty filtering
4. `src/features/mapping/components/SpecialtyMapping.tsx` - UI filtering
5. `src/features/analytics/` - All analytics components
6. `src/features/fmv/` - Fair Market Value components

### **Filtering Strategy**
1. **Service Level**: Add provider type filtering to all data services
2. **Component Level**: Use provider context to filter displayed data
3. **Hook Level**: Update custom hooks to respect provider type context
4. **Context Level**: Ensure context updates trigger proper re-renders

### **Data Flow Fix**
```
User selects APP in sidebar
‚Üì
ProviderContext updates
‚Üì
All screens receive APP context
‚Üì
Data services filter by APP provider type
‚Üì
Only APP data is displayed
```

## üìã **Implementation Checklist**

### **Phase 1: Context & Services**
- [ ] Review and fix ProviderContext implementation
- [ ] Update IndexedDBService with provider type filtering
- [ ] Update SpecialtyMappingService with provider type filtering
- [ ] Test context updates and data filtering

### **Phase 2: Specialty Mapping Screen**
- [ ] Update SpecialtyMapping component to filter by provider type
- [ ] Update specialty lists to show only relevant data
- [ ] Test with both physician and APP data
- [ ] Verify no cross-contamination

### **Phase 3: Analytics Screens**
- [ ] Update all analytics components
- [ ] Update analytics hooks

## üö® **Critical Success Criteria**

1. **Data Isolation**: No cross-contamination between provider types
2. **Context Persistence**: Provider type selection maintained across navigation
3. **Performance**: No performance degradation from filtering
4. **User Experience**: Clear indication of which provider type is active
5. **Data Integrity**: All data operations respect provider type context

## ‚úÖ **Implementation Status**

### **Phase 1: COMPLETED ‚úÖ**
- **Fixed IndexedDBService.getAllSpecialtyMappings()** 
  - Removed heuristic specialty name-based detection (lines 575-621)
  - Now uses actual `survey.providerType` field for filtering
  - Filters mappings based on survey sources that belong to the correct provider type
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### **Phase 2: IN PROGRESS üîÑ**
- **Testing the fix** - Development server started

# Analytics Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **What Was Accomplished**

The analytics screen has been completely refactored to fix the critical issue where `n_orgs` and `n_incumbents` were being incorrectly aggregated across all compensation metrics. The new implementation properly stacks survey tables and maintains separate organizational counts for each metric section.

## 🏗️ **New Architecture**

### **1. AnalyticsDataService** (`src/features/analytics/services/analyticsDataService.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Core service for data retrieval, normalization, and stacking
- **Key Features**:
  - Retrieves data from IndexedDB using the existing DataService
  - Normalizes data using specialty, provider type, and region mappings
  - Implements proper data stacking without incorrect aggregation
  - Maintains separate `n_orgs` and `n_incumbents` for each metric section

### **2. Updated useAnalyticsData Hook** (`src/features/analytics/hooks/useAnalyticsData.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages analytics data state and filtering
- **Key Changes**:
  - Now uses AnalyticsDataService instead of old CSV-based logic
  - Properly handles filter changes with automatic refetching
  - Applies client-side filtering for additional refinement

### **3. Refactored Analytics Component** (`src/components/Analytics.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Main entry point for analytics
- **Key Changes**:
  - Now uses SurveyAnalytics component from the analytics feature
  - Removed old hardcoded analytics logic
  - Clean, maintainable structure following enterprise standards

## 🔧 **How Data Stacking Works**

### **Before (Incorrect)**
```typescript
// Old approach - incorrectly aggregated n_orgs/n_incumbents across all metrics
const aggregatedRecord = {
  n_orgs: totalNOrgs,           // ❌ Wrong - aggregated across all metrics
  n_incumbents: totalNIncumbents, // ❌ Wrong - aggregated across all metrics
  tcc_p50: tccValue,
  wrvu_p50: wrvuValue,
  cf_p50: cfValue
};
```

### **After (Correct)**
```typescript
// New approach - proper stacking with separate counts per metric section
const aggregatedRecord = {
  // TCC metrics with their own n_orgs/n_incumbents
  n_orgs: this.calculateTccNOrgs(rows),           // ✅ Correct - only TCC rows
  n_incumbents: this.calculateTccNIncumbents(rows), // ✅ Correct - only TCC rows
  
  // wRVU metrics (calculated separately)
  wrvu_p50: this.calculatePercentile(rows.map(r => r.wrvu_p50), 50),
  
  // CF metrics (calculated separately)
  cf_p50: this.calculatePercentile(rows.map(r => r.cf_p50), 50),
  
  // ... other percentiles
};
```

## 📊 **Data Flow**

1. **Data Retrieval**: AnalyticsDataService fetches data from IndexedDB
2. **Normalization**: Data is normalized using specialty, provider type, and region mappings
3. **Stacking**: Multiple surveys are stacked using normalized names
4. **Aggregation**: Each metric section maintains its own organizational counts
5. **Filtering**: Client-side filtering provides additional refinement

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **1. Start Development Server**
```bash
npm start
```

### **2. Navigate to Analytics**
- Go to the analytics screen in your application
- Check the browser console for debug logs from AnalyticsDataService

### **3. Run Test Scripts**
- Open browser console
- Run the test functions from `test-analytics-data.js`:
  ```javascript
  testAnalyticsDataService()    // Test core service
  testDataNormalization()       // Test data normalization
  testDataStacking()           // Test data stacking
  ```

### **4. Verify Data Structure**
- Each record should have proper `n_orgs` and `n_incumbents`
- Data should be loaded from IndexedDB, not static CSV
- Filtering should work by specialty, survey source, provider type, region

## 🔍 **Key Benefits**

1. **Correct Data Structure**: Each metric section now has its own organizational counts
2. **Proper Data Stacking**: Multiple surveys are properly combined using normalized names
3. **Real-time Data**: Data comes from IndexedDB instead of static files
4. **Enterprise Standards**: Follows proper separation of concerns and maintainability
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new survey sources and metrics

## 🚨 **What to Watch For**

1. **Console Logs**: Look for debug logs starting with `🔍 AnalyticsDataService:`
2. **Data Loading**: Verify data is loading from IndexedDB instead of CSV
3. **Filtering**: Test that filters work correctly and update the data
4. **Performance**: Monitor for any performance issues with large datasets

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the implementation** with real data
2. **Validate data accuracy** - ensure n_orgs/n_incumbents are correct
3. **Performance optimization** if needed
4. **User feedback** and refinement

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**

- ✅ Analytics screen loads data from IndexedDB
- ✅ Each metric section has separate n_orgs/n_incumbents
- ✅ Data is properly stacked from multiple surveys
- ✅ Filtering works correctly
- ✅ No more incorrect aggregation of organizational counts

The analytics screen is now properly architected and should display the correct data structure as requested.

## üéØ **Key Documentation**

### **Phase 5c: Service Consolidation**
**Status**: DEFERRED until feature development is complete

This is a major enterprise optimization that will consolidate multiple data services into a unified service pattern. It was intentionally postponed during the professional cleanup to avoid interfering with active feature development.

**When to implement**: After Call Pay survey data and other survey types are built and stable.

**Reference**: [Phase 5c: Service Consolidation](architecture/PHASE_5C_SERVICE_CONSOLIDATION.md)

## üöÄ **Current Status**

The Survey Aggregator has undergone comprehensive professional cleanup and is now:
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise-grade codebase** with clean architecture
- ‚úÖ **Professional project structure** with organized documentation
- ‚úÖ **Optimized dependencies** and clean imports
- ‚úÖ **Ready for feature development** (Call Pay survey data)
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** with all functionality preserved

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **Build Call Pay survey data** feature
2. **Implement other survey types** as needed
3. **Complete feature set** development
4. **Consider Phase 5c** service consolidation when features are stable
